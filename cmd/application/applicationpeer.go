// A wrapper around a Peer (github.com/Honorable-Knights-of-the-Roundtable/roundtable/internal/peer/peer.go)
// to encapsulate a variety of peer-specific items.
//
// The Peer itself is included, meaning the codec and many networking elements are included,
// as is the PeerIdentifier (github.com/Honorable-Knights-of-the-Roundtable/roundtable/pkg/signalling/peeridentifier.go)
// so is the AudioFormatConversionDevice (github.com/Honorable-Knights-of-the-Roundtable/roundtable/pkg/audiodevice/device/audioformatconversiondevice.go)
// and so is the AudioAugmentationDevice (github.com/Honorable-Knights-of-the-Roundtable/roundtable/pkg/audiodevice/device/audioaugmentationdevice.go)
//
// Effectively, this struct is a nice interface for sending/receiving audio from the network at an application-level without
// worrying about the underlying devices.
//
// If you need an identifier for this struct, consider appPeer.peer.Identifier(), which gives the identifier
// of the underlying peer (i.e. the UUID and address of the remote client represented by this peer)
//
// When modelling this struct as a AudioSourceDevice, the PCMFrames are sourced from the AudioAugmentationDevice,
// (which comes after the AudioFormatConversionDevice) and not the Peer directly.
// This means that, assuming everything has been constructed correctly, the PCMFrames sourced are in the same format as the
// client's AudioOutputDevice.
// It is *not* enforced that the audio arrives with a specific frame duration, e.g. one ApplicationPeer might source frames
// of 20ms, another frames of 40ms, and another still with frames of 2.5ms. This discrepancy is inherent to the audio transmission
// of peers across the network and must be handled by a downstream device.
// It is expected that the SourceStream of this struct is added to a FanInDevice to mix the audio from multiple peers at once.
// The FanInDevice will also handle the above issue of frame durations by buffering the sourced frames and producing
// evenly sampled lengths from each input.
// | ---------------------- ApplicationPeer ---------------------- |
// [ Peer -> AudioFormatConversionDevice -> AudioAugmentationDevice] -> FanInDevice -> Client's audio output device (e.g. speaker)
//
// When modelling this struct as a AudioSinkDevice, the PCMFrames are fed into an AudioFormatConversionDevice, and not the Peer directly.
// This means that the sink frames are expected to be in the format of the client's audio input device, i.e.
// frames may have a different sample rate, different number of channels, or a different frame duration than
// what is expected by the underlying peer, but this is handled by the audioFormatConversionDevice.
// The SinkStream of this peer should be added to a FanOutDevice to allow the client's audio input device to be passed to multiple peers.
